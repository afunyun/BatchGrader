CODE REVIEW FOR src/batch_runner.py

- **Duplicated Code:**
  - **Status:** Partially Addressed
  - **Description:**
    - Token counting logic has been moved to `token_utils.py`
    - Remaining duplication in LLM client initialization and token logging
    - Similar file processing logic in `process_file` and `process_file_concurrently`
  - **Recommendation:**
    1. Consolidate LLM client management in new `llm_utils.py` (already implemented)
    2. Refactor file processing to reduce duplication between `process_file` and `process_file_concurrently`
    3. Move token limit checking to `token_utils` (already implemented)
  - **Changes Made:**
    - Added new utility functions in `token_utils.py`:
      - `calculate_token_stats`: Calculate token statistics
      - `check_token_limit`: Check token usage against limits
      - `get_token_count_message`: Format token statistics
    - Created new `llm_utils.py` with:
      - `get_llm_client`: Centralized LLM client initialization
      - `log_token_usage`: Centralized token logging
      - `process_with_token_check`: Unified token checking and processing

- **Broad Exception Handling:**
  - **Status:** Addressed. Specific exceptions are now caught, and a general fallback includes a full stack trace.
  - **Description:** Many try-except blocks catch all exceptions without specificity (e.g., lines 641-650, lines 679-688), which can mask critical errors.
  - **Recommendation:** Catch specific exceptions (such as `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`) and handle them appropriately. Log unexpected exceptions with detailed stack traces, but avoid catching all exceptions unless absolutely necessary.

- **Verbose Logging:**
  - **Status:** Addressed. Logging for tiktoken issues has been consolidated.
  - **Description:** Logging is overly verbose with redundant messages (e.g., multiple error logs for tiktoken issues on lines 607-613).
  - **Recommendation:** Consolidate related log messages and use appropriate log levels (`debug` for details, `info` for key steps, `error` for failures) to reduce noise.

- **Hardcoded Values and Magic Strings/Numbers:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** Hardcoded values like `TOKEN_LIMIT = 2_000_000` (line 730) and magic strings like `"custom_id"` (line 658) are scattered throughout the code.
  - **Recommendation:** Move these to a configuration file or a dedicated constants module to improve maintainability and clarity.

- **Mixed Responsibilities in Functions:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** Functions like `process_file` (lines 564-674) handle multiple tasks (file loading, token counting, batch processing, result saving), making them complex and hard to test.
  - **Recommendation:** Break these into smaller functions with single responsibilities. For example, separate token counting, file processing, and result aggregation.

- **Inconsistent File Path Handling:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** The code uses a mix of `os.path` and `pathlib.Path` for file path operations (e.g., lines 566-571).
  - **Recommendation:** Standardize on `pathlib.Path` for all file path handling to ensure cross-platform compatibility and cleaner code.

- **CLI Argument Handling Mixed with Logic:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** CLI argument parsing and validation are intertwined with the main execution flow (lines 697-742), reducing readability.
  - **Recommendation:** Move CLI parsing into a separate function or module to isolate it from the core logic.

- **Unused or Redundant Code:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** Some blocks, like the `finally` block in `process_file_concurrently` (line 503), appear unused or redundant.
  - **Recommendation:** Remove or comment out unused code, and add explanatory comments if placeholders are intentional.

- **Code Length and Complexity:**
  - **Status:** Still an issue.
  - **Description:** The file is over 780 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities (CLI parsing, file processing, token counting, batch job execution, etc.), violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
  - **Recommendation:** Split the file into smaller, focused modules. For example:
    - `cli.py` for argument parsing and main execution flow.
    - `batch_processor.py` for batch job handling and concurrent processing.
    - `file_utils.py` for file loading, saving, and splitting logic.
    - `token_utils.py` for token counting and cost estimation
